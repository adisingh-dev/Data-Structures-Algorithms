## üî• Some Advanced Concepts

For those aiming to go beyond standard DSA:

- **Segment Tree & Fenwick Tree (BIT)** ‚Äì For efficient range queries and updates.
- **Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find)** ‚Äì Used in Kruskal‚Äôs MST and cycle detection in graphs.
- **KMP & Rabin-Karp Algorithm** ‚Äì Essential for efficient string pattern matching.
- **Number Theory & Mathematics** ‚Äì Covers GCD, LCM, Modular Arithmetic, and Prime Factorization.
- **Advanced Graph Algorithms** ‚Äì Includes Tarjan‚Äôs (SCC), Floyd-Warshall, and Johnson‚Äôs Algorithm.
- **Suffix Array & Suffix Tree** ‚Äì Useful for advanced string matching problems.
- **Mo‚Äôs Algorithm** ‚Äì Optimized approach for answering range queries offline.
- **Game Theory** ‚Äì Includes Grundy numbers, Nim Game, and optimal strategies.
- **Trie + Bit Manipulation** ‚Äì Useful for problems involving XOR queries and efficient searching.
- **Heavy-Light Decomposition (HLD)** ‚Äì Advanced technique for handling tree queries efficiently.

## üß† Main Idea

- Finish DSA learning in a limited amount of time and get out of tutorial hell ASAP.
- To learn how to think in a DSA problem and master pattern recognition.
- Learn fundamentals of all DSA topics and be confident that we finished the learning plan successfully.



---
## üéØ Goal

- Finish the learning part **ASAP** so that we can start our **practice** as soon as possible. This will build your confidence and, most importantly, prevent getting stuck in the loop of endless learning.
- Be ready for **practice and improve your problem-solving skills**.
